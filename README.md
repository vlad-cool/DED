## Description
This program can solve square equations

## Build & Run
### Build
- `make`
### Run
- `./build/square`

## Usage
- press e + enter, then enter three numbers - coefficients of square equation in form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` to solve square equation
- press t + enter to run automatic tests (check Autotests for file format)
- press q + enter to quit

## Autotests
- in file named input.txt first line contains one number N
- next N lines contains 4-6 numbers, first 3 are coefficients a, b, c of square equation in form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, then n - number of roots, then roots from lesser to higher
